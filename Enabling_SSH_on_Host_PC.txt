The following procedure details the steps required to enable
and start an OpenSSH server on a windows 10 PC. I have added
steps 3. and 4. which may be necessary for some users and on
some computers.  

1. Install additional feature OpenSSH server.

   Navigate to            	Settings->Apps->Manage optional features->Add a feature
   Double click on 		OpenSSH Server

   Once installation is complete reboot the PC.


2. Configure sshd and ssh-agent services to start automatically.

   Navigate to			Computer Management->Services and Applications->Services
   Right click on 		OpenSSH Authenticaton Agent

   Click on			Apply
   Click on                     OK 
   Right click on 		OpenSSH SSH Server
   Click on 			Properties

3. Change local account to administrator

   Click on			<User account name>

4. Enable ssh port in 3rd party virus protection firewall.

   Where 3rd party virus protection is in use enable access to port 22 in the virus
   protection software's firewall configuration.
